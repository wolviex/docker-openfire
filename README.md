## Usage

If you need a MySQL database you can link container :

    docker run --name openfire-mysql -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes -e MYSQL_DATABASE=openfire -e MYSQL_USER=openfireuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=openfirepasswd -d mysql

in case you want to used pre-existing mysql container , you can add the new database by connecting to it with _docker exec -it some-mysql bash_ and manual adding openfire database or you can link and used quantumobject/docker-mywebsql to create database openfire with user openfireuser plus need to grant all permision of this user to the database.  
  
Them link and run the  openfire container: (updated to wolviex for latest)

    docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -p 5222:5222 -p 5269:5269 -p 5223:5223 -p 7443:7443 -p 7777:7777 -p 7070:7070 -p 5229:5229 -p 5275:5275 --link openfire-mysql:db --name openfire wolviex/openfire:latest

 or to be able to used with plugins for Openfire Meetings : (updated to wolviex for latest)

    docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -p 7443:7443 -p 7777:7777 -p 7070:7070 -p 5000-6000:5000-6000/tcp/udp --link openfire-mysql:db --name openfire wolviex/openfire:latest 

where when been ask for database need to replace localhost for db.

## Accessing the openfire applications:

After that check with your browser at addresses plus the port assigined by docker or you:

  - **http://host_ip:9090/**

where MySQL user will be openfireuser with password for the database openfire at db , then need to add email and password for admin account.

When done configuring OpenFire and adding some users you can use the internal web client :

  - ** http://host_ip:9090/sparkweb/ **

To access the container from the server that the container is running :

    docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash

note: -p 5000-6000:5000-6000/tcp/udp ,  This only needed if you going to used plugins for  Openfire Meetings.

note: deploy this container behind proxy with SSL for extra security:
